    <a name="1.1">1.1.</a> What is PHP?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    From the <A href="http://www.php.net/manual/">manual</a>:

    <blockquote>
      <p>PHP Version 3.0 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of
      its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique
      PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language is to
      allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly.
    </blockquote>
    A nice introduction to PHP by Stig Sæther Bakken can be found <a
    href="http://www.zend.com/zend/art/intro.php">here</a> on the Zend
    website.
  <p>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>
    <a name="1.2">1.2.</a> What is the relation between the versions?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    PHP/FI 2.0 is an early and no longer supported version of PHP. PHP 3
    is the successor to PHP/FI 2.0 and is a lot nicer. PHP 4 is the latest
    generation of PHP, which uses the <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend
    engine</a> under the hood.
  <p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>
    <a name="1.3">1.3.</a> Can I run several versions of PHP at the same time?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    Yes. See the INSTALL file that is included in the PHP 4 source distribution.
  <p>

  <dt><b>
    <a name="1.4">1.4.</a> What are the differences between PHP 3 and PHP 4?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    There are <a href="http://www.zend.com/zend/art/">a couple of articles</a> written on this by the authors of PHP4. Here's a list of some of the more important new features:
    <ul>
      <li>Extended API module 
      <li>Generalized build process under UNIX 
      <li>Generic web server interface that also supports multi-threaded web servers 
      <li>Improved syntax highlighter 
      <li>Native HTTP session support 
      <li>Output buffering support 
      <li>More powerful configuration system 
      <li>Reference counting 
    </ul>
    Please see the <a href="http://www.zend.com/zend/whats-new.php">What's new in PHP4 overview</a> for a detailed explanation of these features and more.

  <dt><b>
    <a name="1.5">1.5.</a> How did you do those pop-out windows for the Search and Mirror buttons on the PHP site (www.php.net)?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    Our site designer, Colin Viebrock (<A href="mailto:cmv@privateworld.com">cmv@privateworld.com</a>), says:

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>Those fancy pop-out layers are done with Dynamic HTML (DHTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Javascript (version 1.2).<p>
    There are plenty of references on the web about DHTML and CSS, including:
    <p><ul>
    <li>CSS Level 1 Spec: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1">www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1</a>
    <li>Macromedia's DHTML Zone: <a href="http://www.dhtmlzone.com/index.html">www.dhtmlzone.com/index.html</a>
    <li>Webreference's DHTML Lab: <a href="http://www.webreference.com/dhtml/">www.webreference.com/dhtml/</a>
    <li>Guide to Cascading Style Sheets: <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/">www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/</a>
    <li>Dynamic Duo - Cross-Browser DHTML: <a href="http://www.dansteinman.com/dynduo/">www.dansteinman.com/dynduo/</a>
    <li>Netscape's Guide to JS 1.2: <a href="http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/communicator/jsguide/js1_2.htm">developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/communicator/jsguide/js1_2.htm</a>
    </ul>
    <p>But your best source of information is to view the source code to the pages on the PHP site.
    To see the actual DHTML/Javascript code, use your browser's "View Source" function.  To see how this code was
    generated dynamically using PHP, click on the "Source" button in the upper-right corner of any PHP page.  You
    will probably also want to view the source of the "shared.inc" file - there is a link to it at the bottom of every
    source page.

  <dt><b>
    <a name="2.1">2.1.</a> Is there a PHP mailing list?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    Of course! To subscribe, send mail to
    <code>php3-subscribe@lists.php.net</code>. You don't need to include
    anything special in the subject or body of the message.

    <p>To unsubscribe, send mail to <code>php3-unsubscribe@lists.php.net</code>.

    Help! I can't seem to unsubscribe from the mailing list!
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    If you have problems subscribing to or unsubscribing from the
    PHP mailng list, it may be because the mailing list software
    can't figure out the correct mailing address to use. If
    your email address was <code>joeblow@example.com</code>,
    you can send your subscription request to
    <code>php3-subscribe-joeblow=example.com@lists.php.net</code>,
    or your unsubscription request to
    <code>php3-unsubscribe-joeblow=example.com@lists.php.net</code>.
  <p>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>
    <a name="2.3">2.3.</a> Is there an archive of the mailing list anywhere?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    Yes, you will find a list of archive sites on the <a href="/support.php">Support</a>
    page.<p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>
    <a name="2.4">2.4.</a> What can I ask the mailing list?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    Since PHP is growing more and more popular by the day the traffic has increased on the PHP mailing list and as of now the list gets about 150 to 200 posts a day. Because of this it
    is in everyones interest that you use the list as a last resort when you have looked everywhere else.
    </P><p>
    Before you post to the list please have a look in this FAQ and the manual to see if you can find the help there. If there is nothing to be found there try out the mailing list
    archives (see above). If you're having problem with installing or configuring PHP please read through all included documentation and README's. If you still can't find any information
    that helps you out you're more than welcome to use the mailing list.
  </dd>
  <p>
  <dt><b>
    <a name="2.5">2.5.</a> What information should I include when posting to the mailing list?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    Posts like "I can't get PHP up and running! Help me! What is
    wrong?" are of absolutely no use to anyone. If you're having problems
    getting PHP up and running you must include what operating system
    you are running on, what version of PHP you're trying to set up,
    how you got it (pre-compiled, CVS, RPMs and so on), what you have
    done so far, where you got stuck and the exact error message.
    <p>
    This goes for any other problem as well. You have to include
    information on what you have done, where you got stuck, what
    you're trying to do and, if applicable, exact error messages. If
    you're having problems with your source code you need to include
    the part of the code that isn't working. Do not include more code
    than necessary though!  It makes the post hard to read and a lot of
    people might just skip it all together because of this. If you're
    unsure about how much information to include in the mail it's better
    that you include to much than to little.
    <p>
    Another important thing to remember is to summarize your problem
    on the subject line. A subject like "HELP MEEEE!!!" or "What is the
    problem here?" will be ignored by the majority of the readers.

    You can download PHP from any of the members of the
    PHP network of sites. These can be found at <A
    href="http://www.php.net/">http://www.php.net/</a>.
    You can also use anonymous CVS to get the absolute latest

  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    Yes, although they are not always up to date.  The Windows binary is
    generally current, but the Unix binaries lag behind and are only available
    for certain platforms.  All download are available in the <a href="/downloads.php">
    Downloads</a> section.

    <a name="3.4">3.4.</a> How do I get these libraries to work?

  <dd>
    You will need to follow instructions provided with the library. Some of
    these libraries are detected automatically when you run the 'configure'
    script of PHP (such as the GD library), and others you will have to
    enable using '--with-EXTENSION' options to 'configure'. Run 'configure
    --help' for a listing of these.

  <dd>
    First, you will need Microsoft Visual C++ v6 (v5 may do
    it also, but we do it with v6), and you will need to <A
    href="http://www.php.net/extra/win32build.zip">download the
    support files</a>. You will need to unzip this file (which
    has subdirectories, so make sure your unzip program keeps them)

<h2>4. Connecting to databases</h2>
</a>

<dl>
  <dt><b>
    <a name="4.1">4.1.</a> I heard it's possible to access Microsoft SQL Server from PHP. How?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    On Windows 95/NT machines, you can simply use the included ODBC support
    and the correct ODBC driver.

    <p>A copy of step-by-step ODBC setup can be found <a href="/manual/config-odbc.html">here</a>.

    <p>On Unix machines, you can use the Sybase-CT driver
    to access Microsoft SQL Servers because they are (at
    least mostly) protocol-compatible. Sybase has made a <A
    href="/extra/ctlib-linux-elf.tar.gz">free version of the necessary
    libraries for Linux systems</a>.  For other Unix operating systems,
    you need to contact Sybase for the correct libraries.  Also see
    the answer to the next question - 1.6.
  <p>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>
    <a name="4.2">4.2.</a> Can I access Microsoft Access databases?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    Yes. You already have all the tools you need if you are running
    entirely under Windows 95/98 or NT, where you can use ODBC and Microsoft's
    ODBC drivers for Microsoft Access databases.<p>
    If you are running PHP on a Unix box and want to talk to MS-Access on
    a Windows box you will need Unix ODBC drivers.
    <A href="http://www.openlinksw.com/">OpenLink Software</a> has Unix-based
    ODBC drivers that can do this.  There is a free pilot program where you
    can download an evaluation copy that doesn't expire and prices start at
    $675 for the commercial supported version.

    <p>Another alternative is to use an SQL server that has
    Windows ODBC drivers and use that to store the data, which you can
    then access from Microsoft Access (using ODBC) and PHP (using the
    built-in drivers), or to use an intermediary file format that Access
    and PHP both understand, such as flat-files or dBase databases.
    On this point Tim Hayes from OpenLink software writes:
<blockquote><blockquote>
Using another database as an intermediary is not a good idea, when you can
use ODBC from PHP straight to your database - i.e. with OpenLink's drivers. If
you do need to use an intermediary file format, OpenLink have now released
Virtuoso (a virtual database engine) for NT, Linux and other unix platforms.
Please visit our
<A href="http://www.openlinksw.com/">website</a> for a free download.
</blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>One option that has proven successful is to use MySQL and its
    MyODBC drivers on Windows and synchronizing the databases.  Steve Lawrence
    writes:
<blockquote><blockquote>
<ol>
<li> Install MySQL on your platform according to instructions with MySQL.
Latest available from www.mysql.org (get it from your mirror!). No special
configuration required except when you set up a database, and configure the
user account, you should put % in the host field, or the host name of the
Windows computer you wish to access MySQL with. Make a note of your server
name, username, and password.<p>

<li> Download the MyODBC for Windows driver from the MySQL site. Latest
release is myodbc-2_50_19-win95.zip (NT available too, as well as source
code). Install it on your Windows machine. You can test the operation with
the utilities included with this program.<p>

<li> Create a user or system dsn in your ODBC administrator, located in the
control panel. Make up a dsn name, enter your hostname, user name, password,
port, etc for you MySQL database configured in step 1.<p>

<li> Install Access with a full install, this makes sure you get the proper
add-ins.. at the least you will need ODBC support and the linked table
manager.<p>

<li> Now the fun part! Create a new access database. In the table window right
click and select Link Tables, or under the file menu option, select Get
External Data and then Link Tables. When the file browser box comes up,
select files of type: ODBC. Select System dsn and the name of your dsn
created in step 3. Select the table to link, press ok, and presto! you can
now open the table and add/delete/edit data on your MySQL server! You can
also build queries, import/export tables to MySQL, build forms and reports,
etc.<p>
</ol>
<b>Tips and Tricks:</b>
- You can construct your tables in access and export them to MySQL, then
link them back in. That makes table creation quick.<br>
- When creating tables in access, you must have a primary key defined in
order to have write access to the table in access. Make sure you create a
primary key in MySQL before linking in access.<br>
- If you change a table in MySQL, you have to re-link it in access. Go to
tools&gt;add-ins&gt;linked table manager, cruise to your ODBC DSN, and select the
table to re-link from there. you can also move your dsn source around there,
just hit the always prompt for new location checkbox before pressing ok.

  <dt><b>
    <a name="4.3">4.3.</a> I saw PHP offers persistent database connections.   What does that mean?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    Persistent connections are SQL links that do not close when the
    execution of your script ends.  When a persistent connection is
    requested, PHP checks if there's already an identical persistent
    connection (that remained open from earlier) - and if it exists, it
    uses it.  If it does not exist, it creates the link.  An 'identical'
    connection is a connection that was opened to the same host, with
    the same username and the same password (where applicable).

    <p>People who aren't thoroughly familiar with the way web servers
    work and distribute the load may mistake persistent connects for what
    they're not.  In particular, they do <b>not</b> give you an ability
    to open 'user sessions' on the same SQL link, they do <b>not</b>
    give you an ability to build up a transaction efficently, and they
    don't do a whole lot of other things.  In fact, to be extremely
    clear about the subject, persistent connections don't give you <b>any</b>
    functionality that wasn't possible with their non-persistent brothers.

    <p>Why?

    <p>This has to do with the way web servers work. There are three ways
    in which your web server can utilize PHP to generate web pages.

    <p>The first method is to use PHP as a CGI "wrapper". When run this
    way, an instance of the PHP interpreter is created and destroyed for
    every page request (for a PHP page) to your web server. Because it
    is destroyed after every request, any resources that it acquires (such
    as a link to an SQL database server) are closed when it is destroyed.
    In this case, you do not gain anything from trying to use persistent
    connections -- they simply don't persist.

    <p>The second, and most popular, method is to run PHP as a module
    in a <I>multiprocess</I> web server, which currently only includes
    Apache. A multiprocess server typically has one process (the parent)
    which coordinates a set of processes (its children) who actually do
    the work of serving up web pages. When each request comes in from a a
    client, it is handed off to one of the children that is not already
    serving another client. This means that when the same client makes
    a second request to the server, it may be serviced by a different
    child process than the first time. What a persistent connection does
    for you in this case it make it so each child process only needs
    to connect to your SQL server the first time that it serves a page
    that makes us of such a connection. When another page then requires
    a connection to the SQL server, it can reuse the connection that
    child established earlier.

    <p>The last method is to use PHP as a plug-in for a <I>multithreaded</I>
    web server. Currently this is only theoretical -- PHP does not
    yet work as a plug-in for any multithreaded web servers. Work is
    progressing on support for ISAPI, WSAPI, and NSAPI (on Windows),
    which will all allow PHP to be used as a plug-in on multithreaded
    servers like Netscape FastTrack, Microsoft's Internet Information
    Server (IIS), and O'Reilly's WebSite Pro. When this happens, the
    behavior will be essentially the same as for the multiprocess model
    described before.

    <p>If persistent connections don't have any added functionality,
    what are they good for?

    <p>The answer here is extremely simple -- efficiency.  Persistent
    connections are good if the overhead to create a link to your SQL
    server is high.  Whether or not this overhead is really high depends
    on many factors.  Like, what kind of database it is, whether or
    not it sits on the same computer on which your web server sits,
    how loaded the machine the SQL server sits on is and so forth.
    The bottom line is that if that connection overhead is high,
    persistent connections help you considerably.  They cause the child
    process to simply connect only once for its entire lifespan, instead
    of every time it processes a page that requires connecting to the
    SQL server.  This means that for every child that opened a persistent
    connection will have its own open persistent connection to the server.
    For example, if you had 20 different child processes that ran a script
    that made a persistent connection to your SQL server, you'd have 20
    different connections to the SQL server, one from each child.

    <p>An important summary.  Persistent connections were designed to
    have one-to-one mapping to regular connections.  That means that you
    should <b>always</b> be able to replace persistent connections with
    non-persistent connections, and it won't change the way your script
    behaves.  It <b>may</b> (and probably will) change the efficiency
    of the script, but not its behavior!

    <a name="5.3">5.3.</a> I installed PHP from an RPM, but it doesn't
    compile with the database support I need! What's going on here?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    Due to the way PHP is currently built, it is not easy to build a
    complete flexible PHP RPM.  This issue will be addressed in PHP4.
    For PHP, we currently suggest you use the mechanism described in the
    INSTALL.REDHAT file in the PHP distribution.  If you insist on using
    an RPM version of PHP, read on...
    <p>Currently the RPM packagers are setting up the RPMS to install
    without database support to simplify installations <strong>and</strong>
    because RPMS use /usr/ instead of the standard /usr/local/ directory for
    files.  You need to tell the RPM spec file which databases to support
    and the location of the <em>top-level</em> of your database server.
    <p>This example will explain the process of adding support for the
    popular MySQL database server, using the mod installation for Apache.
    <p>Of course all of this information can be adjusted for any database
    server that PHP supports.  We will assume you installed MySQL and Apache
    completely with RPMS for this example as well.

    <ul>
    <li>First remove mod_php3<br>
    <code>rpm -e mod_php3</code><br>

    <li>Then get the source rpm and INSTALL it, NOT --rebuild<br>
    <code>rpm -Uvh mod_php3-3.0.5-2.src.rpm</code><br>
    <li>Then edit the /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/mod_php3.spec file<br>
    In the %build section add the database support you want, and the path.<br>
    For MySQL  you would add <code>--with-mysql=/usr \</code><br>
    The %build section will look something like this:<br>

    <pre>
	./configure --prefix=/usr \
	--with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs \
	--with-config-file-path=/usr/lib \
	--enable-debug=no \
	--enable-safe-mode \
	--with-exec-dir=/usr/bin \
	--with-mysql=/usr \
	--with-system-regex
    </pre>

    <li>Once this modification is made then build the binary rpm as follows:<br>
    <code>rpm -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/mod_php3.spec </code><br>
    <li>Then install the rpm<br>
    <code>rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/mod_php3-3.0.5-2.i386.rpm</code><br>
    </ul>

    Make sure you restart Apache, and you now have PHP with MySQL support
    using RPM's.  Note that it is probably much easier to just build
    from the distribution tarball of PHP and follow the instructions in
    INSTALL.REDHAT found in that distribution.

Also make sure that this AddType line is not hidden away inside a &lt;Virtualhost&gt; or &lt;Directory&gt; block which would
prevent it from applying to the location of your test script.
    <li> Finally, the default location of the Apache configuration files changed between Apache 1.2 and Apache 1.3.  You

    There are two things to check here.  First, for some reason
    when Apache builds the apxs Perl script, it sometimes ends up
    getting built without the proper compiler and flags variables.
    Edit your apxs (sometimes found in /usr/local/apache/bin/apxs
    or /usr/sbin/apxs) and check for these lines:
<pre>my $CFG_CFLAGS_SHLIB  = '&nbsp;';      # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LD_SHLIB      = '&nbsp;';          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = '&nbsp;';      # substituted via Makefile.tmpl</pre>
    If this is what you see, you have found your problem.  Change these lines to say:
<pre>my $CFG_CFLAGS_SHLIB  = '-fpic -DSHARED_MODULE';      # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LD_SHLIB      = 'gcc';          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = q(-shared);# substituted via Makefile.tmpl </pre>
    The second possible problem should only be an issue on RedHat-6.1.
    The apxs script RedHat ships is broken.  Look for this line:
<pre>my $CFG_LIBEXECDIR    = 'modules';        # substituted via APACI install</pre>
    If you see the above line, change it to this:
<pre>my $CFG_LIBEXECDIR    = '/usr/lib/apache';        # substituted via APACI install</pre>

    exactly what you want.  You should also have a look at the magic_quotes_gpc directive in your php3.ini
    file.
  <p>
    The ereg_replace magic you're looking for, however, is simply:<pre>
    $escaped = ereg_replace(&quot;'&quot;, &quot;\\'&quot;, $input);</pre>

  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    In PHP, the ending for a block of code is either "?&gt;" <b>or</b>
    "?&gt;\n" (where \n means a newline). This means that you need to
    insert an extra newline after each block of PHP code in the above
    example.
    <p>
    Why does PHP do this? Because when formatting normal HTML, this
    usually makes your life easier because you don't want that newline,
    but you'd have to create extremely long lines or otherwise make the
    raw page source unreadable to achieve that effect.

    The getallheaders() function will do this if you are running PHP as a

    headers:<pre>
    $headers = getallheaders();
    for(reset($headers); $key = key($headers); next($headers)) {

    The security model of IIS is at fault here. This is a problem
    common to all CGI programs running under IIS.  A workaround is
    to create a plain HTML file (not parsed by php) as the entry page
    into an authenticated directory.  Then use a META tag to redirect
    to the PHP page, or have a link to the PHP page.  PHP will
    then recognize the authentication correctly.  When the ISAPI
    module is ready, this will no longer be a problem.  This should
    not effect other NT web servers.  For more information, see: <A

    Make sure any user who needs to run a PHP script has the rights

    any authenticated user will also need rights to execute php.exe.  And
    for IIS4 you need to tell it that PHP is a script engine.

    Very good question!  ;)  This is a tricky little issue and it has come up twice in the
    past month as of this writing.  Both times I ended up spending a good 20 minutes trying to
    figure out what the heck was going on.  The answer is that both IE and Lynx ignore any NULs
    (\0) in the HTML stream.  Netscape does not.  The best way to check for this is to compile
    the command-line version of PHP (also known as the CGI version) and run your script from the
    command line and pipe it through 'od -c' and look for any \0 characters.  (If you are on
    Windows you need to find an editor or some other program that lets you look at binary files)
    When Netscape sees a NUL in a file it will typically not output anything else on that line
    whereas both IE and Lynx will.  If this issue has bitten you, congratulations!  You are not
    alone.

   You need to turn off the short tags by setting short_tags to 0 in your

  </b></dt>
  <dd>
   One of the easiest things to do is to enable using ASP tags in your
   PHP code. This allows you to use the ASP-style &lt% and %&gt; code
   delimiters. Most of the popular HTML editors handle those more
   intelligently (for now). To enable the ASP-style tags, you need
   to set the asp_tags php3.ini variable, or use the php3_asp_tags
   Apache directive.

   The best way is to stick a &lt;?phpinfo()?&gt; tag on a page and load it up.  This will
   show you all sorts of information about your PHP setup, including a list of both
   environment variables and also special variables set by your web server.  This list
   can't really be documented in the PHP documentation because it will change from one

  <dd>
   You are trying to use a result identifier that is 0.  The 0 indicates that your query failed
   for some reason.  You need to check for errors after submitting a query and before you
   attempt to use the returned result identifier.  The proper way to do this is with code similar
   to the following:<pre>
        $result = mysql_query("select * from tables_priv");
        if(!$result) {
            echo mysql_error();
            exit;
        }</pre>
   or:<pre>
        $result = mysql_query("select * from tables_priv")

  </b></dt>
  <dd>
   When submitting a form, it is possible to use an image instead of
   the standard submit button with a tag like:
   <pre>&lt;input type="image" SRC="image.gif" NAME="foo"&gt;</pre>
   When the user clicks somewhere on the image, the accompanying form
   will be transmitted to the server with two additional variables:
   foo.x and foo.y.
   <p>
   Because $foo.x and $foo.y are invalid variable names in PHP, they are
   automagically converted to $foo_x and $foo_y.  That is, the periods
   are replaced with underscores.

<h2>8. PHP and HTML</h2>

    <a name="8.1">8.1.</a> How do I create an array in a HTML &lt;form&gt;?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    To get your &lt;form&gt; result sent as an array to your PHP script
    you name the &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt; or &lt;textarea&gt;
    elements like this:
    <pre>
    &lt;input name="MyArray[]"&gt;
    &lt;input name="MyArray[]"&gt;
    &lt;input name="MyArray[]"&gt;
    &lt;input name="MyArray[]"&gt;
    </pre>
    Notice the square brackets after the variable name, that's what
    makes it an array. You can group the elements into different arrays
    by assigning the same name to different elements:
    <pre>
    &lt;input name="MyArray[]"&gt;
    &lt;input name="MyArray[]"&gt;
    &lt;input name="MyOtherArray[]"&gt;
    &lt;input name="MyOtherArray[]"&gt;
    </pre>
    This produces two arrays, MyArray and MyOtherArray, that gets sent
    to the PHP script.
    <p>
    <i>Note that you must not use indices with arrays in HTML!</i> The
    array gets filled in the order the elements appear in the form. For
    functions you can use to process these arrays once you get them into
    your scripts, please see the Arrays section in the manual.

<h2>9. PHP and other languages</h2>

  <dt><b>
    <a name="9.1">9.1.</a> PHP vs. ASP?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    ASP is not really a language in itself, it's an acronym for Active
    Server Pages, the actual language used to program ASP with is a
    script version of Visual Basic.  The biggest drawback of ASP is that
    it's a proprietary system that is natively used only on Microsofts
    Internet Information Server (IIS). This limits it's availability to
    Win32 based servers. There are a couple of projects in the works
    that allows ASP to run in other environments and webservers; <a
    href="http://www.halcyonsoft.com/prods/iasp/iasp.htm">InstantASP</a>
    from <a href="http://www.halcyonsoft.com/">Halcyon</a> (commercial),
    <a href="http://www.chilisoft.com/chiliasp/default.asp">Chili!Soft
    ASP</a> from <a href="http://www.chilisoft.com/">Chili!Soft</a>
    (commercial) and <a href="http://www.activescripting.org/">OpenASP
    from ActiveScripting.org</a> (free).  ASP is said to be a slower
    and more cumbersome language than PHP, less stable as well. Some of
    the pros of ASP is that since it uses VBScript it's relatively easy
    to pick up the language if you're already know how to program in
    Visual Basic. ASP support is also enabled by default in the IIS
    server making it easy to get up and running.

  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    PHP is commonly said to be faster and more efficient for complex
    programming tasks and trying out new ideas. PHP is generally referred
    to as more stable and less resource intensive as well. Cold Fusion
    has better error handling, database abstraction and date parsing
    although database abstraction is being addressed in PHP 4. Another
    thing that is listed as one of Cold Fusion's strengths is its excellent
    search engine, but it has been mentioned that a search engine is not
    something that should be included in a web scripting language. PHP
    runs on almost every platform there is; Cold Fusion is only available
    on Win32, Solaris, Linux and HP/UX.  Cold Fusion has a better IDE
    and is generally easier to get started with, whereas PHP initially
    requires more programming knowledge.

    <p>A great summary by Michael J Sheldon on this topic has
    been posted to the PHP mailing list. A copy can be found <a

    <a name="9.4">9.4.</a> PHP vs. Perl?
  </b></dt>
  <dd>
    The biggest advantage of PHP over Perl is that PHP was designed for
    scripting for the web where Perl was designed to do a lot more and can
    because of this get very complicated. The flexibility / complexity
    of Perl makes it easier to write code that another author / coder
    has a hard time reading. PHP has a less confusing and stricter format
    without losing flexibility.  PHP is easier to integrate into existing
    HTML than Perl. PHP has pretty much all the 'good' functionality of
    Perl; constructs, syntax and so on, without making it as complicated
    as Perl can be. Perl is a very tried and true language, it's been
    around since the late eighties, but PHP is maturing very quickly.

    This probably means that PHP is having some sort of problem
    and is core-dumping. Look in your server error log to see if
    this is the case, and then try to reproduce the problem with
    a small test case. If you know how to use 'gdb', it is very
    helpful when you can provide a backtrace with your bug report
    to help the developers pinpoint the problem.  If you are using
    PHP as an Apache module try something like:
    <ul>
      <li> Stop your httpd processes
      <li> gdb httpd
      <li> &gt; run -X -f /path/to/httpd.conf
      <li> Then fetch the URL causing the problem with your browser
      <li> If you are getting a core dump, gdb should inform you of this now
      <li> type: bt
      <li> Send the resulting backtrace to <a href="mailto:php-dev@lists.php.net">php-dev@lists.php.net</a>
    </ul>
    <p>
    If your script uses the regular expression functions (<code>ereg()</code>
    and friends), you should make sure that you compiled PHP and
    Apache with the same regular expression package. (This should
    happen automatically with PHP and Apache 1.3.x)

    Environment variables are now normal global variables, so you must

    No, PHP works fine with the FrontPage extensions.
    The problem is that the FrontPage patch modifies several Apache structures,
