+#    (hopefully the way to call initlog won't change!)
+#
+# why doing this: the pb of initlog being called when syslog is being
+# restarted is that minilogd is started to keep the logs waiting for syslog to
+# really treat them. Alas with devfs mounted (with or without devfsd),
+# minilogd do not exit as it should. I don't know why.
+#
+# minilogd keeping the logs means its memory usage grows a lot as time goes.
+# Restarting syslog mainly happens when upgrading glibc.
