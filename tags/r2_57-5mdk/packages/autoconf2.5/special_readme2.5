-- PLEASE NOTICE ---> this version is meant to coexist with autoconf-2.13
(for backwards compatibility); to that end, the various binaries are
actually linked to a script which decides which version to execute. It
tries to be clever and will execute 2.5x if `configure.ac' is present, or
if `configure.in' contains AC_PREREQ and the value's 3 first letters are
stringwise greater than '2.1'. You can also manually select it by
providing the environment variable WANT_AUTOCONF_2_5 set to `1' (use
WANT_AUTOCONF_2_1 if you want the 2.13 version).
