Tripwire is an integrity checking system that will alert you if any unauthorized
changes are made to your filesystem.  The default tripwire policy tries to be as
comprehensive as possible, however it will require tailoring to your specific
configuration in order for it to be completely useful.
.LP
To begin, you will need to create your local and site keys, and this can be done
with the \fBtwinstall.sh\fR script located in the \fI/etc/tripwire\fR directory.
Once you have run this script you should execute:
.IP
tripwire --init
.LP
to initialize the database.  Once you have initalized the database and created
the policy file to suit your system, you should remove the cleartext copies of
the configuration and policy files, typically \fItwcfg.txt\fR and \fItwpol.txt\fR.
You can obtain more information on the configuration file by reading twconfig(4) and
the policy file by reading twpolicy(4).
.LP
If you need to make changes to the policy and/or configuration files, you can generate
a cleartext copy again by decrypting the encrypted equivalents.  To do this, execute:
.nf
       cd /etc/tripwire
       twadmin --print-cfgfile > twcfg.txt
       twadmin --print-polfile > twpol.txt
.fi
.LP
You can redirect the output to any file you like, but the \fBtwinstall.sh\fR script
looks for these exact files if you wish to re-run that script to generate the encrypted
policy and configuration files.  You can, of course, use twadmin(8) directly for this
purpose as well:
.nf
       cd /etc/tripwire
       twadmin --create-cfgfile --cfgfile ./tw.cfg \
         --site-keyfile [site_key] ./twcfg.txt
       twadmin --create-polfile --cfgfile ./tw.cfg \
         --site-keyfile [site_key] ./twpol.txt
.fi
.LP
By default, tripwire performs a check every day via cron, which will be sent to the
root user on the local system by default, so you'll either want to configure the
policy file to send the report to another email address or make sure that you receive
the root user's email on this system.  To run a check manually or to check for specific
things, you can use tripwire(8) directly.
.LP
As you upgrade your system with new packages, make changes to configuration files, etc.
you will need to keep updating your database.  In order to do this, use the \fBtwupdate\fR
script.  This script will update the database against the latest integrity check performed.
To ensure it is completely up-to-date, you will want to perform a check immediately prior
to updating the database.
.LP
Ideally, when you are upgrading packages, you should perform a check before and after the
upgrade.  This ensures you have a sane baseline and a very small window of opportunity for
things to be changed without your notice.  If you update a number of packages one day and do
not update the database for a few days, there is the possibility of a file being modified
without your knowledge; with a large number of changed files in the report, you may be
unaware of these changes.  If you perform a check prior to the update, you will see what
files have changed and can immediately judge if you have anything to be concerned with.
Once you update packages, you should run another check and ensure that no other files have
changed that do not look like they belong to any of the packages you updated.  Once you
have run this check and confirmed that everything is ok, use \fBtwupdate\fR to update the
database.  Practicing this will make tripwire a much more valuable and reliable tool.
