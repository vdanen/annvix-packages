  BIO_set_fp patch added. (no more core under RH6.0).
  Correct rm -rf of /var/tmp

* Mon Mar 22 1999 rse
- function names recently changed - consistency.

- Be consistent: 0.9.2b

* Mon Mar 22 1999 Ben Laurie, problem pointed out by Holger Reif, Bodo Moeller (and ???)
- Fix security hole.

* Sat Mar 20 1999 Ulf Moeller <ulf@fitug.de>
- Some more source tree cleanups (removed obsolete files 
  crypto/bf/asm/bf586.pl, test/test.txt and crypto/sha/asm/f.s; changed 
  permission on "config" script to be executable) and a fix for the 
  INSTALL document.    Submitted by: Ulf Moeller <ulf@fitug.de> Reviewed 
  by: Ralf S. Engelschall

* Sun Mar 14 1999 Lennart Bang <lob@netstream.se>, with minor changes by Steve
- Remove some references which called malloc and free instead of Malloc 
  and Free.

* Fri Mar 12 1999 Ulf Moeller <ulf@fitug.de>
- Fail if test fails.

* Fri Mar 12 1999 Matthias Loepfe <Matthias.Loepfe@AdNovum.CH>
- Solaris shared library support.

* Fri Mar 12 1999 Ben Laurie
- Use the right compiler for ctx_size.

* Fri Mar 12 1999 Steve Henson
- Delete NULL ciphers from 'ALL' in the cipher list aliases. This means 
  that NULL ciphers specifically have to be enabled with e.g. 
  "DEFAULT:eNULL". This prevents cipher lists from inadvertantly having 
  NULL ciphers at the top of their list (e.g. the default ones) because 
  they didn't have to be taken into account before.

* Thu Mar 11 1999 Steve Henson
- Fix for RSA private key encryption if p < q. This took ***ages*** to 
  track down.

* Wed Mar 10 1999 Matthias Loepfe <Matthias.Loepfe@adnovum.ch>
- Be less restrictive and allow also `perl util/perlpath.pl 
  /path/to/bin/perl' in addition to `perl util/perlpath.pl /path/to/bin', 
  because this way one can also use an interpreter named `perl5' (which 
  is usually the name of Perl 5.xxx on platforms where an Perl 4.x is 
  still installed as `perl').    Submitted by: Matthias Loepfe

* Tue Mar  9 1999 Ben Laurie

- Add missing funtions from non ANSI section of header files and add 
  missing ordinals to libeay.num.

* Mon Mar  8 1999 Ralf S. Engelschall
- Make `openssl version' output lines consistent.
- Fix Win32 symbol export lists for BIO functions: Added 
  BIO_get_ex_new_index, BIO_get_ex_num, BIO_get_ex_data and 
  BIO_set_ex_data to ms/libeay{16,32}.def. I'm not a Win32 hacker, but I 
  think I've done it correctly.    Steve or Ben: can you confirm that 
  it's correct? I don't want to break any Win32 stuff.
- Second round of fixing the OpenSSL perl/ stuff. It now at least 
  compiled fine under Unix and passes some trivial tests I've now added. 
  But the whole stuff is horribly incomplete, so a README.1ST with a 
  disclaimer was added to make sure no one expects that this stuff really 
  works in the OpenSSL 0.9.2 release. Additionally I've started to clean 
  the XS sources up and fixed a few little bugs and inconsistencies in 
  OpenSSL.{pm,xs} and openssl_bio.xs.    PS: I'm still not convinces 
  whether we should try to make this finally running or kick it out and 
  replace it with some other module....

  Added info in the documentation as well.

* Sat Mar  6 1999 Ralf S. Engelschall
- Add a useful kludge to allow package maintainers to specify compiler 
  and other platforms details on the command line without having to patch 
  the Configure script everytime: One now can use ``perl Configure 
  <id>:<details>'', i.e. platform ids are allowed to have details 
  appended to them (seperated by colons). This is treated as there would 
  be a static pre-configured entry in Configure's %table under key <id> 
  with value <details> and ``perl Configure <id>'' is called.  So, when 
  you want to perform a quick test-compile under FreeBSD 3.1 with pgcc 
  and without assembler stuff you can use ``perl Configure 
  "FreeBSD-elf:pgcc:-O6:::"'' now, which overrides the FreeBSD-elf entry 
  on-the-fly.      (PS: Notice that the same effect _cannot_ be achieved 
  by using ``make CC=pgcc ..'' etc, because you cannot override all 
  things from there.)

  questions now is the OpenSSL core team under openssl-core@openssl.org.  
  And add a paragraph about the dual-license situation to make sure 
  people recognize that _BOTH_ the OpenSSL license _AND_ the SSLeay

  Additonally cleaned up the `make links' target: Remove unnecessary

  confusing stuff. Instead only the actually done links are displayed.

- Add a bunch of SSL_xxx() functions for configuring the temporary RSA 
  and DH private keys and/or callback functions which directly correspond 
  to their SSL_CTX_xxx() counterparts but work on a per-connection basis. 
  This is needed for applications which have to configure certificates on 
  a per-connection basis (e.g. Apache+mod_ssl) instead of a per-context 
  basis (e.g. s_server).      For the RSA certificate situation is makes 
  no difference, but for the DSA certificate situation this fixes the "no 
  shared cipher" problem where the OpenSSL cipher selection procedure 
  failed because the temporary keys were not overtaken from the context 
  and the API provided no way to reconfigure them.    The new functions 
  now let applications reconfigure the stuff and they are in detail: 
  SSL_need_tmp_RSA, SSL_set_tmp_rsa, SSL_set_tmp_dh, 
  SSL_set_tmp_rsa_callback and SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback.  Additionally a 
  new non-public-API function ssl_cert_instantiate() is used as a helper 
  function and also to reduce code redundancy inside ssl_rsa.c.

- Make `openssl x509 -noout -modulus' functional also for DSA 
  certificates (in addition to RSA certificates) to match the behaviour 
  of `openssl dsa -noout -modulus' as it's already the case for `openssl 
  rsa -noout -modulus'.  For RSA the -modulus is the real "modulus" while 
  for DSA currently the public key is printed (a decision which was 
  already done by `openssl dsa -modulus' in the past) which serves a 
  similar purpose.  Additionally the NO_RSA no longer completely removes 
  the whole -modulus option; it now only avoids using the RSA stuff. Same 
  applies to NO_DSA now, too.
