+# Annvix skeleton smb.conf file
+#
+# The "default" smb.conf file is too bloody big and with too many
+# bloody options so we install this minimal, yet fully functional,
+# smb.conf.  For the full-meal-deal look at smb.conf_full.  No one
+# should ever be subject to a config file with so many comments.
+#
+# This config file is pretty much comment-less, so refer to the
+# docs/manpages or the smb.conf_full file.
+#
+#
+# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
+# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
+# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options (perhaps too
+# many!) most of which are not shown in this example
+#
+# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) 
+# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
+# for commentry and a ; for parts of the config file that you
+# may wish to enable
+#
+# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command "testparm"
+# to check that you have not made any basic syntactic errors.
