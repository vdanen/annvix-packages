The following details the changes from Annvix 1.0-RELEASE apache2 packages
to Annvix 1.1-RELEASE httpd packages:

- all packages are named httpd-* rather than apache2-*
- the apache root has moved from /etc/httpd/2.0 to /etc/httpd
- the mod_userdir module is no longer part of the base apache modules installation
  for security reasons (this module provides http://foo/~user style access).  It
  can be installed by executing "urpmi httpd-mod_userdir".
- the /etc/httpd/conf.d directory has been renamed to /etc/httpd/modules.d and should
  only contain module-specific configuration files
- a new /etc/httpd/conf/vhosts.d directory has been added to simplify the setup of
  virtual hosts (drop in a config file and restart apache)
- the commonhttpd.conf and httpd2.conf configuration files have been merged into
  a single httpd.conf file.  Review it and your old configuration and make the
  appropriate changes for your configuration
