-- PLEASE NOTICE ---> this version is meant to coexist with autoconf-2.5x;
to that end, the various binaries are actually linked to a script which
decides which version to execute.
Newer version (>= 2.5x) is always executed, unless pre-generated
`configure' script exists and is generated by autoconf 2.13. You can
also manually select this version (2.13) by setting the environment
variable WANT_AUTOCONF_2_1 to `1'. The variable WANT_AUTOCONF_2_5 has no
effect now.
