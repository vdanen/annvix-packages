This patch is needed to improve the probability that the MySQL tests pass
in Red Hat's build environment.  The 32-bit and 64-bit variants of a single
architecture may be built on the same machine at the same time, so we have
to ensure that the tests use different port numbers on a 64-bit arch than
on a 32-bit, else they will interfere with each other.  Also increase a
timeout that has been observed to get violated under heavy load.
