# ignore_list is a special rule definition
# the attributes listed in it are not displayed in the
# final report

#
# NOTE: this default configuration file does not use md5 checks
# due to the fact that md5 is fairly trivial to spoof now, so
# rely on more "important" checksums

# Essential system binaries should be monitored on all attributes, with a

# System logs should be allowed to change, and even to switch inode numbers.
# The inode modification is because of Red Hat's automatic log cycling.
LOG=p+n+u+g

# Device files should simply maintain ownership, permissions and such.
# It doesn't make sense to monitor contents.  We also ignore inode
# mod (c) because this changes every reboot.

# Essential system config files (/etc/fstab, /etc/hosts.allow) should
# be watched very closely.
CONF=p+i+n+u+g+s+m+c+sha1+rmd160

# Most directories need to allow for new files to be added, so we

# Directories that likely will change often but don't need much special

# /var is difficult, as it contains logs, mail queues, and mailboxes, to
# name a few type of files.
#   1) The log directory is hard to watch, because of the log cycling.
#   2) The spool/cron should be watched.  We can watch very closely if we
#      are willing to disallow cron.
#   3) The spool/mail directory should only be watched for permissions, but
#      not for content, since mail files will be added with new users.
