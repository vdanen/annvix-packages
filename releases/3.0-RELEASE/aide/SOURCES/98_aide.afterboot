AIDE is an integrity checking system that will alert you if any unauthorized
changes are made to your filesystem.  The default AIDE configuration tries to be as
comprehensive as possible, however it will require tailoring to your specific
configuration in order for it to be completely useful; to do this edit the
\fI/etc/aide.conf\fR file.
.LP
To begin, execute:
.IP
# aideinit
.LP
to initialize the database.  Unlike Tripwire, AIDE uses no encryption to protect the
configuration or database files so you must ensure that only root has access to these
files.  By default, \fI/etc/aide.conf\fR is mode 0600 and \fI/var/lib/aide\fR is mode
0700 (the latter contains the database file(s)).
.LP
By default, AIDE performs a check every day via cron, which will be sent to the
root user on the local system by default, so you'll want to make sure that you receive
the root user's email on this system.  To run a check manually or to check for specific
things, you can use \fBaide\fR(1) directly or use Annvix's AIDE check and update scripts
(\fB/etc/cron.daily/aide\fR and \fB/usr/sbin/aideupdate\fR respectively).
.LP
As you upgrade your system with new packages, make changes to configuration files, etc.
you will need to keep updating your database.  In order to do this, use the \fBaideupdate\fR
script.  This script will update the database against the current filesystem.  The \fI--check\fR
option to AIDE simply reports on the current state of the filesystem compared to the database,
whereas \fI--update\fR performs both a check and updates the database.
.LP
Ideally, when you are upgrading packages, you should perform an update before and after the
upgrade.  This ensures you have a sane baseline and a very small window of opportunity for
things to be changed without your notice.  If you update a number of packages one day and do
not update the database for a few days, there is the possibility of a file being modified
without your knowledge; with a large number of changed files in the report, you may be
unaware of these changes.  Once you update packages, you should run another check and ensure that no other files have
changed that do not look like they belong to any of the packages you updated.  Once you
have run this check and confirmed that everything is ok, use \fBaideupdate\fR to update the
database.  Practicing this will make AIDE a much more valuable and reliable tool.
.LP
Because AIDE does not use any encryption or crytographic verification of the database, and
because the database is a plaintext file, the Annvix AIDE package ships with wrapper scripts
that enforce the use of \fBgpg\fR(1) to perform verification of the database.  Although this is
not manadatory, if you opt not to use gpg for verification, you will need to modify or
replace the \fI/etc/cron.daily/aidecheck\fB script so that gpg is not used.
.LP
Rather than using the \fI--init\fR option with \fBaide\fR you should use the Annvix
\fBaideinit\fR wrapper script.  This script will generate an initial database and will
also generate a gpg(1) private key for use with AIDE.  Note that the email address assigned
to the GPG key is "aide@hostname" so if you move database files from one host to another and/or
use another copy of AIDE for offline verification, you will need to export the public key of the
one host to import on the other.
.LP
To create a new gpg key and initialize the database, execute:
.IP
# aideinit
.LP
Once the database and gpg private key is generated, you can use \fB/etc/cron.daily/aide\fR to
check the database against the current filesystem and \fBaideupdate\fR to update the database.
These scripts make use of gpg's ability to create a detached signature of a file to verify
it's validity.  The cron check script will alert you if the file has changed or if the detached
signature is missing, as will the update script.  When you run \fBaideupdate\fR you will need
to provide your gpg passphrase to create a new detached signature of the database.
.LP
When \fBaideupdate\fR is run, the old database file is rotated out, compressed, and renamed to
\fIaide-[hostname]-[datestamp]-[timestamp].db.gz\fR in the \fI/var/lib/aide\fR directory.  The
current AIDE database is always named \fIaide.db\fR.
