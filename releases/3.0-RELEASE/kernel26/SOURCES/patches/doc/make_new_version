Make new version
-----------------------

You need to include a new patch into the kernel, and you want to do it
the proper way, what is the proper way?

Well, we will consider two scenaries:

- update a patch/driver
- include a new driver

1st scenary:  you want to update one patch
------------------------------------------

0- We create a work directory.

1- untar the tarball for the kernel that you want to modify, and apply
   any pre/rc patch that you need.

   We will assume that you have unpacked 2.4.20-rc2 in the directory
   linux-2.4.20-rc2.

2- untar the tarball of patches of the previous version.
   
   We will assume that we have them in the directory 2.4.20-q3.

3- We create a copy of the tarball with hardlinks (believe me, it will make 
   everything easier each time that you screw thing, and have to 
   begin again from the beggining).

   In the working directory we issue this command:

	cp -dpilR linux-2.4.20-rc2 w1

   Note: having an alias to do the copies, help here:

	alias kcp='cp -dpilR'

3- We want to update the patch FS70_supermount.patch

   We apply all the patches until that patch (not including it)

	cd w1
	../2.4.20-q3/scripts/apply_patches --stop=fs70 ../2.4.20-q3/patches/

4- We create a copy of our current tree

	cd ..

	kcp w1 w2

5- We read FS70_supermount.patch to find if the previous packager wrote 
   some help about how to apply new versions of the patch.

6- We integrate our new patch into the w2 tree.

7- Once that we are happy, we create the patch. We go to the working 
   directory, and then:

	diff -urNp w1 w2 > diff
	
8- We READ the patch, and make sure that there is nothing that we don't 
   want in the patch.

9- We update the patch

	mv diff 2.4.20-q3/patche/FS70-2_supermount.patch

10- We continue applying patches until the end:

	cd w1
	../2.4.20-q3/scripts/apply_patches --start=fs70 ../2.4.20-q3/patches/
	
11- We update the number of the version (patch ZZ01).

12- We update the configs to the new kernel (only needed if there are new 
    config entries).  It is always safe to do it:

	cd w1
	../2.4.20-q3/scripts/update_configs ../2.4.20-q3/configs

   This will update the files in ../2.4.20-q3/configs with up-to-date configs.
   If any changes are needed, you will be asked.

13- You check, that all the configs that are done from that ones for all the 
    configs are buildable:

	cd w1
	../2.4.20-q3/scripts/create_configs ../2.4.20-q3/configs

14- make a tar ball and you are gone.

2nd scenary: You want to add a new driver
-----------------------------------------

In this scenary I will show you how to include a new driver in the kernel.
