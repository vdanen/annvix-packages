# This file can be used to alter the default behaviour of mkinitrd.
# It is a bash shell script that is sourced by mkinitrd before option parsing
# so variables set there will be used by mkinitrd instead of defaults.
# Be aware that modifying this file is not supported and should be done only
# as a workaround to specific problems.
# To see what can be set here check the mkinitrd script (hint: look at the
# beginning of the script and at lines following 'while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do')
