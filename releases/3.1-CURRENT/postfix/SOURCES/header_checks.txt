# Jim Seymour's Postfix anti-virus/worm/trojan header_checks recommendations.
#
# WARNING: Use at your own risk! No warranty of suitability or fitness for
# any particular use is expressed or implied.
#
# NOTE: These are PCRE (map type "pcre:") expressions.  Your copy of Postfix
# must have been built with PCRE support for these.
#
# Additional Notes
#
#   These checks are predicated on the fact that you're using a version
#   of Postfix that's got MIME parsing.  I don't recall when that was
#   added, but it's certainly in Postfix 2.x (which is what I use).  If
#   in doubt: Join the postfix-users mailing list and ask!
#
#   In the postfix-users mailing list, Noel Jones asserts that:
#
#     "postfix mime_header_checks can miss broken mime headers that a
#      mail client may decide are "close enough" to work.  A filename
#      can be encoded to not match the regexp.
#
#      So just because you use mime_header_checks to reject these
#      file types doesn't mean they won't be accepted anyway.  Be
#      aware of the limitations."
#
#   These might more effectively be placed in a separate
#   mime_header_checks file, so that they're not run against all the
#   headers, but just the MIME headers.
#
#   These (mime) header checks *will* work on the "triple-extension"
#   exploit (Ref: http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/56/29137.html),
#   to the best of my knowledge.
#
# Information on header checks, and other Postfix anti-UCE measures, can

# resources.
