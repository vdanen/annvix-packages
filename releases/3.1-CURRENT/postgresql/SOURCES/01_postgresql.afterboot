The PostgreSQL database server is a powerful RDBMS useful for a number of
applications, however it is important to secure and protect your data. 
Before upgrading PostgreSQL you should always make a dump of your data; you
likely should be doing this more often as well.
.LP
To protect your data you should make a backup copy of your
\fI/var/lib/pgsql/pg_hba.conf\fR file.  You should also dump the contents of
your database which can be done with the \fBpg_dumpall\fR(1) command like this:
.IP
# /sbin/chpst -u postgres /usr/bin/pg_dumpall >$backup
.LP
where \fI$backup\fR is the backup file to contain the database contents.
.LP
To restore the contents of the file, use:
.IP
# /sbin/chpst -u postgres /usr/bin/psql -f $backup
.LP
This will restore the contents of your backup file to the PostgreSQL
database.

To quickly setup PostgreSQL for use, become root (using \fBsudo\fR(8)) and then
\fBsu\fR(1) to the \fIpostgres\fR user.  Use the \fBcreateuser\fR(1) command to create a
user to access the database.  Log out from the postgres user and ensure that
the postgresql service is running, then log out from root and test the
connection by connecting to the server (\fBpsql -U [username\fR).

\fBUpgrading PostgreSQL\fR
.LP
The PostgreSQL manual has some definite steps for upgrading from one major
version of PostgreSQL to another (for instance to upgrade from 7.3.x to
8.0.x).  Essentially, you will need to dump the contents of your database,
upgrade, re-initialize the database, then restore the contents of the
database.  This can be done by following these steps:
.IP
# /sbin/chpst -u postgres /usr/bin/pg_dumpall > outputfile
.br
# srv --down postgresql
.br
# mv /var/lib/pgsql /var/lib/pgsql.bk
.br
# apt-get update postgresql-server
.br
# srv --up postgresql
.br
# /sbin/chpst -u postgres /usr/bin/psql -f outputfile
.LP
At this point you should be back up and running with your upgraded PostgreSQL
database.  It is always advisable to read the PostgreSQL manual online
(specifically the parts dealing with upgrades) prior to upgrading.  The RPM
package for postgresql-server should initialize a new database if an existing
one is not present (which is why it is important to move \fI/var/lib/pgsql\fR prior
to upgrading the server).  If you do not do this, you will need to use \fBinitdb\fR(1)
manually to initialize the new database.
