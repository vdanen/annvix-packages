 configure source code packages using templates and an @code{m4} macro
 package.  This is edition @value{EDITION}, for Autoconf version @value{VERSION}.
 
+-+-+-+-+--- PLEASE NOTICE ---> this version is meant to coexist with autoconf-2.5x
+(see node Autoconf-2.5x for info documentation on latest autoconf version).
+To that end, the various binaries are actually linked to a script which
+decides which version to execute. It tries to be clever and will execute
+2.5x if `configure.ac' is present, or if `configure.in' contains AC_PREREQ
+and the value's 3 first letters are stringwise greater than '2.1'. If
+anything fails, you can manually select 2.13 by providing the environment
+variable WANT_AUTOCONF_2_1 set to `1' (use WANT_AUTOCONF_2_5 if you want
+the 2.5x version).
