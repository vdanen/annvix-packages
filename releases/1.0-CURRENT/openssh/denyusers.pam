# Deny users from using PAM authentication in OpenSSH
#
# This file contains a list of users, one per line, that will not be
# permitted to authenticate against the PAM subsystem.  This is desireable
# in cases where UsePAM needs to be enabled, but PermitRootLogin is using a
# more flexible setting like "without-password".  By default, root is never
# permitted to authenticate via PAM.
