+Note that on \fBbiarch\fP platforms, i.e. systems which can run both
+32-bit and 64-bit applications (x86-64, ppc64, s390x, etc.),
+\fIut_tv\fP has the same size in 32-bit mode than in 64-bit
+mode. Likewise for \fIut_session\fP, and \fIut_time\fP if
+present. This allows data files and shared memory to be shared between
+32-bit and 64-bit applications. As a matter of fact, it is recommended
