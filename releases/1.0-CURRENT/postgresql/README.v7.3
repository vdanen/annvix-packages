                                Release 7.3
                                      
     Release date: 2002-11-27
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                                  Overview
                                      
   Major changes in this release:
   
   Schemas
          Schemas allow users to create objects in separate namespaces,
          so two people or applications can have tables with the same
          name. There is also a public schema for shared tables.
          Table/index creation can be restricted by removing permissions
          on the public schema.
          
   Drop Column
          PostgreSQL now supports the ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN
          functionality.
          
   Table Functions
          Functions returning multiple rows and/or multiple columns are
          now much easier to use than before. You can call such a "table
          function" in the SELECT FROM clause, treating its output like a
          table. Also, PL/pgSQL functions can now return sets.
          
   Prepared Queries
          PostgreSQL now supports prepared queries, for improved
          performance.
          
   Dependency Tracking
          PostgreSQL now records object dependencies, which allows
          improvements in many areas. "DROP" statements now take either
          CASCADE or RESTRICT to control whether dependent objects are
          also dropped.
          
   Privileges
          Functions and procedural languages now have privileges, and
          functions can be defined to run with the privileges of their
          creator.
          
   Internationalization
          Both multibyte and locale support are now always enabled.
          
   Logging
          A variety of logging options have been enhanced.
          
   Interfaces
          A large number of interfaces have been moved to
          http://gborg.postgresql.org where they can be developed and
          released independently.
          
   Functions/Identifiers
          By default, functions can now take up to 32 parameters, and
          identifiers can be up to 63 bytes long. Also, OPAQUE is now
          deprecated: there are specific "pseudo-datatypes" to represent
          each of the former meanings of OPAQUE in function argument and
          result types.

                          Migration to version 7.3
                                      
   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release. If your application examines the
   system catalogs, additional changes will be required due to the
   introduction of schemas in 7.3; for more information, see:
   http://www.ca.postgresql.org/docs/momjian/upgrade_tips_7.3.
   
   Observe the following incompatibilities:
   
     * Pre-6.3 clients are no longer supported.
     * "pg_hba.conf" now has a column for the user name and additional
       features. Existing files need to be adjusted.
     * Several "postgresql.conf" logging parameters have been renamed.
     * LIMIT #,# has been disabled; use LIMIT # OFFSET #.
     * "INSERT" statements with column lists must specify a value for
       each specified column. For example, INSERT INTO tab (col1, col2)
       VALUES ('val1') is now invalid. It's still allowed to supply fewer
       columns than expected if the "INSERT" does not have a column list.
     * serial columns are no longer automatically UNIQUE; thus, an index
       will not automatically be created.
     * A "SET" command inside an aborted transaction is now rolled back.
     * "COPY" no longer considers missing trailing columns to be null.
       All columns need to be specified. (However, one may achieve a
       similar effect by specifying a column list in the "COPY" command.)
     * The data type timestamp is now equivalent to timestamp without
       time zone, instead of timestamp with time zone.
     * Pre-7.3 databases loaded into 7.3 will not have the new object
       dependencies for serial columns, unique constraints, and foreign
       keys. See the directory "contrib/adddepend/" for a detailed
       description and a script that will add such dependencies.
     * An empty string ('') is no longer allowed as the input into an
       integer field. Formerly, it was silently interpreted as 0.
