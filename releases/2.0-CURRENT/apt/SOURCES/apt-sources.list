# Package repository URL's
#
# Signed repositories have a [<key>] where <key> is the name of the key
# as it appears in vendors.list. If you remove it, no digital signature check
# will be made.
#
# See http://qa.mandriva.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/CookerMirrors for a full list 
# of mirrors.
#
# You can also get mirrors from easyurpmi.zarb.org

# format is simple :
# 1) rpm is the type of archive
# 2) server is the path to the main directory
# 3) list is the relative path to the list, from the main directory
# 4) rpms is the relative path to the rpms, from the main directory

# you cannot use synthesis.hdlist, but you can take a hdlist.src, to install SRPM
# with apt.

# example 
# rpm ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/linux/distributions/Mandrakelinux/devel/cooker/i586/media/ media_info/hdlist_main main
