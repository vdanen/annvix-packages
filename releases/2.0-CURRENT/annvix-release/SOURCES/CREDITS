Annvix was initially based upon Mandrivalinux 9.2 but has changed quite drastically
since that initial fork.  Most of the packaging remains relatively Mandriva-specific
and is in fact taken from Mandrivalinux releases and/or Mandriva's Cooker.  To that
end, a lot of development work, patches, etc. that are in Annvix have been, and will
continue to be, taken from Mandriva.

The bulk of the work for Annvix 1.0-RELEASE was done by the lead (and sole) developer
Vincent Danen.  For a brief period of time, both Oden Eriksson and Thomas Backlund
were involved, but both departed for unspecified reasons, leaving full development
responsibilities to Annvix's founder, Vincent Danen.

Joining for 1.1-CURRENT, Sean P. Thomas has taken a co-developer role and is
largely responsible for the many enhancements to srv, Annvix's own service
management tool.  Sean left the development team just before 1.1-RELEASE became
available.

Thanks to Ying-Hung Chen for his work and help with postfix and ports packages.

However, the following people have been instrumental in Mandrivalinux releases and
are therefore also credited here as much of their work has been taken from Mandrivalinux
and put into Annvix:

Per Oyvind Karlsen, Olivier Thauvin, Buchan Milne, Andrey Borzenkov, Stefan Van Der Eijk,
Pascal Terjan, Luca Berra, Olivier Blin, Abel Cheung, Christiaan Welvaart, Götz Wasch.

As well, the Mandrivalinux development team who's work applies in varying degrees to
the packages Annvix has kept:

Fred Lepied, Pixel, Juan Quintela, Stew Benedict, Thierry Vignaud, Gwenole Beauchesne,
Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Warly, Fred Crozat, Florin.

Finally, thanks to God for the moderate amount of brains He's given me so I
could actually manage to put something like this out (and not have it totally suck).  =)
