The OpenLDAP server is an open source implementation of the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol.  It is most often used when a database is required that is read-often
and write-little (such as for user authentication, shared address books, etc.).
.LP
Annvix 1.0-RELEASE shipped with OpenLDAP 2.1.29 whereas Annvix 1.1-RELEASE shipped
with OpenLDAP 2.3.9; the latest release of OpenLDAP at that time.  As a result, data
needs to be migrated from the old version to the newer version.  Although the RPM
scripts attempt to do this in a sane way, as a precaution, users should backup their
LDAP data prior to the upgrade.
.LP
Making a backup of the LDAP database is as simple as using \fBslapcat\fR(8) to connect
to the database and create a "dump" of the database to an LDIF file which could then
be used to re-create the LDAP directory on a a fresh install.  To do so, use:
.IP
\fB/usr/sbin/slapcat >ldap-backup.ldif\fR
.LP
or, if you wish to only create an LDIF file of a particular base DN, use:
.IP
\fB/usr/sbin/slapcat -b "dc=example,dc=com" >ldap-backup.ldif\fR
.LP
The OpenLDAP server daemon (\fBslapd\fR(8)) should not be running to ensure consistency
between the database and the generated LDIF file.  It reads the database files directly;
you will have to be on the server itself in order to execute the command.
.LP
Once you have the backup, you can upgrade OpenLDAP.  If there are any problems with the
import, or if you are migrating the data from one system to another, use the \fBslapadd\fR(8)
program to import the data:
.IP
\fB/usr/sbin/slapadd -cv -l ldap-backup.ldif\fR
.LP
If you backed up just a specific base DN, use:
.IP
\fB/usr/sbin/slapadd -cv -b "dc=example,dc=com" -l ldap-backup.ldif\fR
.LP
When using \fBslapadd\fR(8), be sure that \fBslapd\fR(8) is not running to ensure consistency
of the database.
.LP
You should only use \fBslapcat\fR(8) and \fBslapadd\fR(8) together, and not as a replacement
for using \fBldapadd\fR(1) because they do no schema checking or other coherency checks.
.LP
Creating backups of your OpenLDAP server periodically is a good idea to protect against
corruption, unexpected changes, and especially upgrades.
