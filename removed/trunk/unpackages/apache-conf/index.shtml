	    <h1><a NAME="about"></a>About Apache</h1>

	    <p>This product includes software developed by the Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).</p>

	    <p>The <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Project</a>
	    is a collaborative software development effort aimed
	    at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available
	    source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server. The project is jointly
	    managed by a group of volunteers located around the world, using the Internet
	    and the Web to communicate, plan, and develop the server and its related
	    documentation. These volunteers are known as the Apache Group. In addition,
	    hundreds of users have contributed ideas, code, and documentation to the
	    project.</p>

	    <p>Apache is <b>the most popular web server in the world</b>, with around
	    60% market share, more than twice than Microsoft IIS!</p>

	    <p>According to <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey">Netcraft</a>, "The
	    widespread deployment of Apache amongst hosting companies and ISPs ensures
	    that Apache is in a better position to echo the growth of the web than any
	    other server, and this has been a longterm theme of the Web Server survey."
	    The last Netcraft survey reported more than 22 million Apache servers worldwide.</p>
