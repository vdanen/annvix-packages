  * Patch from <pererik@onedial.se>:
  *   Do cron_sync() before each cron_sleep(), to handle changes to the system
  *   time.
+ *
+ * Redhat bug 29868:
+ * The above patch introduced an anomaly.
+ *
+ * Unwanted double execution can occur for small backwards adjustments in
+ * clock time, such as may occur on a system that regularly syncs its clock
+ * with an outside time source. I suspect a race condition with sleep(3)
+ * as well that triggers this as well. The solution is to enforce the rule
+ * that we cannot wait for time N to occur twice in a row. Time must be 
+ * elastic enough to absorb these small adjustments. <alane@geeksrus.net>
