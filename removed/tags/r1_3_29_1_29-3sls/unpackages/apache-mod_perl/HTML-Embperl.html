<H1>Embperl - Embed Perl in Your HTML Documents</H1>
Embperl gives you the power to embed Perl code in your HTML documents. Using
Perl means being able to use a very elaborate programming language, which is
widely used for WWW purposes. You can also use hundreds of Perl modules
which have already been written - including DBI - for database access to a
growing number of database systems. <p>While this could also be done with
other packages, Embperl has several features especially for HTML: dynamic
tables, formfield-processing, escaping/unescaping and more.  <p>Embperl is a
server-side tool, which means it's browser-indpendent.  It can run in
various ways: Under mod_perl, as a cgi script, or offline.

If you have apache-mod_perl, follow this link to try the
