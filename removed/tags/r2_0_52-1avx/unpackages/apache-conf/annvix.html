	    Like the whole Annvix distribution, this customized version of the Apache web server is
	    compiled with <b>Processor-Specific Optimizations</b> to take advantage of the power of
	    the i586 instructions (on x86 platforms), giving it <b>5-30% more performance</b> than
	    any other Linux Web Server (compiled for i386). For documentation and information on Annvix,
	    please visit the <a href="http://annvix.org/">Annvix</a> web site.
